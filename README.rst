About Mobile Middleware
-------------------------

Mobile Middleware is a middleware for WSGI applications.

Thought to be used on Turbogears 2 applications it detects mobile browser and provides a way
to detect and react to them. Detection expression can be customized and action can
change from plain detection to exposing a specific custom template for mobile requests

You will be able to see if your request is coming from a mobile browser with::

    from tg import request
    request.is_mobile

Installing
-------------------------------

tgext.mobilemiddleware can be installed both from pypi or from bitbucket::

    easy_install tgext.mobilemiddleware

should just work for most of the users

Enabling Mobile Agents Detection
----------------------------------

In your application *config/middleware.py* import **MobileMiddleware**:: 

    from tgext.mobilemiddleware import MobileMiddleware

Change your **make_app** method::

    app = make_base_app(global_conf, full_stack=True, **app_conf)
    return MobileMiddleware(app, app_conf)

Exposing Mobile Templates
----------------------------

**tgext.mobilemiddleware** implements a *@expose_mobile* decorator that works like *@expose*
TurboGears2 decorator which can be used to specify which template to expose for mobie requests.

This will work by registering a custom template renderer with 'mobile' custom format.
*@expose_mobile* supports the same template naming convention that @expose uses
and can accept any rendering engine that has been registered in turbogears
by specifing it as *engine:module.template_name* 

Examples::

    @expose('app.templates.index')
    @expose_mobile('app.templates.mobile.index')
    def index(self, *args, **kw):
        return dict()


Customizing User Agents Detection
-----------------------------------

**MobileMiddleware** by default checks user agent with a regular expression
that can be customized by changing *[app:main]* section of your configuration
file by adding something like::

    mobile.agents = android|fennec|iemobile|iphone|ipod|ipad
